"A note about International shipping:
Bird and Pear ships all over the world and is happy to do it! We will gladly ship to any country where we can track a package all the way to your door. That said, we cannot be held responsible for any VAT, taxes or customs fees imposed by a country outside the USA. Too, if your customs service is having a really bad day, week or month, please donâ€™t hold us responsible for that either!

We read up on all requirements for paperwork and forms for each individual country before we put anything in the mail and do our best to make certain our packaging and paperwork is in compliance but sometimes those folks with all the power are just plain grumpy! We will NOT refund any monies for any item left in customs until the packages are received back in Texas in the exact condition they left. Sometimes this takes months."); ?></p>
